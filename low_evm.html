  <h1>Low-level EVM</h1>
  <div id="description">
    What you may want to do next time there is an EVM challenge popping on Twitter
  </div>
  <div id="content">
<p>
So you've just came across your Twitter TL, and found an EVM challenge that just dropped.
The goal is to steal some ETH on a contract, but you only have 1 hour. So you quickly open the etherscan contract in your browser and see that the contract is not verified.
How's that, how am I supposed to read bytecode ?
Bullet time: that's what we are going to learn today, anon.
</p>

<p>
Although this guide is quite comprehensive about reading and decoding EVM bytecode, it is assumed that you already understand the fundamentals of the Ethereum Blockchain, as well as opcodes. They are amazing writings about those, so I strongly advise you to read them before coming back here if you're not feeling confortable with these notions:
<ul>

        https://blog.openzeppelin.com/deconstructing-a-solidity-contract-part-i-introduction-832efd2d7737</a>
</ul>

      Ready ? Nice !

      <p>
Now that you have grabbed your bytecode, let's try to decipher it.
If you have already written and read Huff, that's even better because that's what we are going to talk about.
Huff is a wrapper around EVM bytecode with <i>some</i> helpers, but not too much. It does not hide the inner workings and quirks of the EVM. It lets you write mnemonics with some syntax sugar like labels, functions, macros, constants, and compile it to pure bytecode.
</p>

<p>

Note: this is a stripped version of the challenge made by Convergence Boy on <a href="https://twitter.com/0x796/status/1608553575969611777">twitter</a>

</p>

<p>
The first step is that we are going to transpile the EVM bytecode into a more readable way. Note that we call it transpilation rather than decompilation because the tool won't do any work for you. But theoretically you could transpile it from bytecode to huff and compile the transpiled version back to bytecode.
It's a tool that I've developed called <a href="https://github.com/iFrostizz/murph">murph</a>, and that's all what it does. Though, I may add some formatting helpers (which is a manual task right now) in order to make the huff code a little bit more readable.
</p>

<p>
This is the bytecode that you just found in the "Contract" tab:
</p>
  <code>0x601f8060093d393df33461001857335461000e573d3dfd5b3d3d3d3d47335af1005b4833553d3df3</code>
  <p>
  Yeah I don't speak that language neither. But let's make it more readable using murph.
</p>
	<code>$ murph -b 0x601f8060093d393df33461001857335461000e573d3dfd5b3d3d3d3d47335af1005b4833553d3df3 -s -f your_file.huff</code>
<p>
<ul><li><code>-b</code> flag stands for "bytecode"
<li><code>-s</code> means that we want to strip the constructor code
<li><code>-f</code> is the file that want to write the code to</ul>
<p>
Now we can open "your_file.huff" to try to decipher that.
</p>
<p>
<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
  callvalue
  jump_24
  jumpi
  caller
  sload
  jump_14
  jumpi
  returndatasize
  returndatasize
  revert
  jump_14:
  returndatasize
  returndatasize
  returndatasize
  returndatasize
  selfbalance
  caller
  gas
  call
  stop
  jump_24:
  basefee
  caller
  sstore
  returndatasize
  returndatasize
  return
}
</pre>
      <p>
We will format it a little bit better for readability
</p>
<p>
<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
  callvalue jump_24 jumpi
  caller sload
  jump_14 jumpi

  returndatasize returndatasize revert

  jump_14:
  returndatasize returndatasize returndatasize returndatasize
  selfbalance caller gas call
  stop

  jump_24:
  basefee caller sstore
  returndatasize returndatasize return
}
</pre>

And even better with comments

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
  callvalue               // [msg.value > 0 ?]
  jump_24 jumpi           // []
  caller sload            // [sload(msg.sender) != 0 ?]
  jump_14 jumpi           // []

  returndatasize returndatasize revert

  jump_14:
  returndatasize returndatasize // [0, 0]
  returndatasize returndatasize // [0, 0, 0, 0]
  selfbalance caller gas        // [gas, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  call                          // [success]
  stop

  jump_24:
  basefee caller                // [msg.sender, basefee]
  sstore                        // []
  returndatasize returndatasize return
}
</pre>

<p>
Now let's deep dive.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Understanding what's going on</h3>
This is the first part of the challenge. Always remember that each instruction is called sequentially on the EVM. You can think of it like a one threaded system.

What can be usually done in Huff is to use stack comments. They are added as comments by the user in order to understand what is the state of the stack at each instruction and they help to understand how everything works.

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
  callvalue
  jump_24 jumpi
}
</pre>

As we enter the main execution, "callvalue" is used. We can lookup what is this instruction in <a href="https://www.evm.codes">evm.codes</a> and see that it returns the value in the current context.
If you're familiar with Solidity, it's like writing "msg.value".

Next, <code>jump_24</code> is a label. It's going to be replaced after compilation by the PC (bytes offset in the init code) and used to JUMP. It was called by murph like that because the JUMPDEST was found and is located at the PC 24. If it was not found it would look like <code>jump_<!24></code>.

JUMPI is a conditional jump. If the condition at position 1 of the stack is nullish, it won't jump. Else (any value else than 0), it's gonna jump.

So we can write it like this:

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
#define macro MAIN() = takes(0) returns(0) {
  callvalue               // [msg.value > 0 ?]
  jump_24 jumpi           // []
}
</pre>

If the value is not 0, it's going to jump to <code>jump_24</code>. What are we doing at this location ?

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff  
  jump_24:
  basefee caller sstore
  returndatasize returndatasize return
</pre>

We are adding <code>basefee</code> and <code>caller</code> on the stack, then using <code>sstore</code>. This is basically storing <code>basefee</code> at <code>msg.sender</code> in the contract storage. After that, we somewhat <code>return</code> from the current execution context, but what are those <code>returndatasize</code> ?

<code>returndatasize</code> is communly used as a "cheap PUSH1 0" by fellow optimizooors. If no call context has been opened just before, the returndatasize will be 0 and it's only taking one bytes, compared to PUSH1 0 which takes 2 bytes and costs 3 gas compared to 2 for the magic trick. Neat, right ?

Note: this may be solved in a future hard fork with the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3855">PUSH0</a> opcode.

Formatting our code, it now looks like that:

 <pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff  
  jump_24:
  basefee caller                // [msg.sender, basefee]
  sstore                        // []
  returndatasize returndatasize return
</pre>

Remembering that we now have stored some stuff at msg.sender in the storage, let's continue !

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
  caller sload
  jump_14 jumpi

  returndatasize returndatasize revert
</pre>

Looks like it's pushing the caller address on the stack, and loading this key from the storage. Seems familiar right ?
Yeah, it's going to load the <code>basefee</code> previously stored at the caller key, which is now a non-nullish value. If we hadn't done that before, that wouldn't have jumped.

#### What would have happened ?

It would had reverted the current execution completely, using <code>returndatasize</code> to push some cheap 0's to feed the revert opcode.

Comments !

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
  caller sload            // [sload(msg.sender) != 0 ?]
  jump_14 jumpi           // []

  returndatasize returndatasize revert
</pre>

Now that we've came past this JUMP, we can see what is under the <code>jump_14</code>

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
  jump_14:
  returndatasize returndatasize
  returndatasize returndatasize
  selfbalance caller gas
  call
  stop
</pre>

still the same returndatasize opcode. We are familiar with it, it's pushing 4 zeros on the stack.
<code>selfbalance</code> is pushing the contract balance on the stack, <code>caller</code> is still the msg.sender, and <code>gas</code> pushes the forwarded gas remaining in the current execution context, and then <code>call</code>.
It's sending the whole contract balance to the caller of this context. Seems like we have a way to drain the contract !
After some magic...

<pre class="huff">
// your_file.huff
  jump_14:
  returndatasize returndatasize // [0, 0]
  returndatasize returndatasize // [0, 0, 0, 0]
  selfbalance caller gas        // [gas, to, value, 0, 0, 0, 0]
  call                          // [success]
  stop
</pre>

... we can write a POC using foundry.

<pre id="solidity">
// POC.t.sol
function testEVM() public {
    bytes memory code = hex"601f8060093d393df33461001857335461
    000e573d3dfd5b3d3d3d3d47335af1005b4833553d3df3";

    address a = deployCode(code);

    // Give some rewards
    vm.deal(a, 10 ether);

    uint256 bal = address(this).balance;
    // 1.
    a.call{value: 1 wei}("");
    // 2.
    a.call("");
    // Check
    assertGt(address(this).balance + 9.9 ether, bal);
}
</pre>

And run it!

<pre id="shell">
<span id="prompt">$ forge test --match-test testEVM</span>
